## What is an Operating System?

An operating system is a software program that manages computer hardware and software resources, providing common services for computer programs.

## What is a Core?

A core is a single processor unit in a multi-core processor. Each core can execute instructions independently, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance.

## What is a Program?

A program is a set of instructions that are executed by a computer. Programs are written in a programming language and are compiled or interpreted by the operating system to create an executable file that can be run on the computer.

## What is a Process?

A process is an instance of a program in execution. Each process has its own memory space and resources, and can be executed independently by the operating system.

## What is Multi-tasking?

Multi-tasking refers to the ability of a computer to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This can be achieved through the use of multiple processes or threads, each running independently and sharing resources as needed.

## What is a Thread?

A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently by the operating system. Each thread has its own program counter and stack, and can be executed concurrently with other threads in the same process.

## What is Multi-threading?

Multi-threading refers to the ability of a computer to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This can be achieved through the use of multiple threads, each running independently and sharing resources as needed.
